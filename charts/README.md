# chart subclasses

These aren't built out yet. In theory, each chart would have its own set of
[`sensible defaults`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configurat\
ion).

Currently, these subclasses mostly just provide their chart_class to the Google
Javascript API, but I anticipate these subclasses being necessary to the design
later down the line &mdash; especially for a casual adherence to the
[Separation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
and [the Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single\
_responsibility_principle). I'm not saying that you should chug your OOP
Kool-Aid without thinking &mdash; but a healthy observation of principles is
usually a good thing. ;)
